# Simulated mouse maze solver

### Micromouse is an event where small robot mice solve a 16Ã—16 maze. The mouse needs to keep track of where it is, discover walls as it explores the maze, and map out the maze and detect when it has reached the goal.The whole event is simulated in a virtual mouse maze.

## Steps to run the simulation:

1. Run the mouse simulation maze -> /mms/bin/mms  
2. Provide the path for the main.cpp file.  
3. Build it and run the simulation.  

## Simulations

1. The objective is to find a path towards the goal point.  
  a. It must create an approximate path.  
  b. It must actually traverse the path to validate it.
